# Used Car Sales Analysis (SQL + Python + Tableau)

## About the Dataset
**Context**  
This dataset contains ~160,000 records of used car sales in the U.S. over a 20-month period (2019‚Äì2020), scraped from Ebay. I was published on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsaustin/us-used-car-sales-data?select=used_car_sales.csv

**Content**  
Each record includes details such as:  
- Selling price  
- Location  
- Make, model, year  
- Mileage and other attributes  

The dataset was pre-filtered by the original author to avoid duplicates from re-listed vehicles.

## Project Goal
The aim of this project is to:  
1. **Clean** the raw dataset in SQL (standardize makes, handle duplicates, remove invalid values).  
2. **Export** the cleaned data for further analysis in Python (Jupyter).  
3. **Visualize** results in Tableau or similar BI tools.  
4. **Generate insights** that could be useful for a hypothetical used car dealership ‚Äî e.g., identifying the most popular brands, average prices, and market trends.

## Workflow
1. **SQL (Data Cleaning)**  
   - Handled inconsistent brand names (e.g., `ponitac`, `PONTlAC` ‚Üí `Pontiac`).  
   - Removed invalid categories such as ‚ÄúOther Makes‚Äù and ‚ÄúReplica/Kit.‚Äù  
   - Deduplicated repeated entries.  
   - Reduced the dataset from ~144k to ~120k valid rows.  

2. **Python (Analysis)** 
   - Use `pandas` for aggregations and descriptive statistics.  
   - Explore average selling prices, mileage, and brand frequencies.  

3. **Tableau (Visualization)** 
   - Build interactive dashboards to highlight the most popular brands and models.  
   - Compare average prices across makes and model years.

## Key Insights
- **Market dominated by older cars:** The average listing is **26 years old**, with **~100k miles** and an average price of **$11,600**.  
- **Private sellers drive supply:** Many low-value, older cars are listed by individuals rather than dealerships.  
- **Price vs. age pattern:** Prices generally fall as cars age, but pick up again for **1970s and earlier models**, where **collector demand drives value**.  
- **Brand trends:** Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan dominate the used-car landscape.
